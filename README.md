# Your Project's Name

This website is for gamers who want to know more about the games they are interested in. Whether if its out of curiousity or if they want to buy the game, this website provides a detailed review on the games they have. It currently does not have back end, but it allows users to log in and browse for games in the browse tab.


 
## Design Process
I made it bright contrasting colours of black and yellow, with a background of a collage of multiple games. This would fit the exciting nature games offer. I made the top bar bright yellow with the name and navigation buttons on opposite sides of the website. I also made the name clickable so that people can intuitively click on the name to go back to the home page.


- As a gamer using the website, I want the website to feel interactive and seamless when i navigate it, so that comfortable adn quickly find what im looking for.
- As a gamer looking to learn more about games, I want to have a website with a variety of games so that i can understand and know more about the developers and gameplay.
- As a gamer looking to buy games, I want to find out more about the games to see if it is worth my money to buy.


## Features

a search button you can search for any game avilable in the website, with or wihtout spaces and capital letters

a review input you can type and insert comments to the review section

a login input, where you can log in to the website
 
### Existing Features
search button allows users to find specific games quickly when they dont want to browse the webpage

review input allows users to send reviews to the online server, and it displays it in the corresponding webpage.

login input allows users to log in to their accounts where it checks against the server for the user to be successfully logged in.

### Features Left to Implement
for the review and log in  inputs, i need to implement some featgure that links t to an online server so that they will work and aside from that, i might add a starring feature so users can choose their rating and have it displayed next to their comments too.

## Technologies Used

i used visual studio code to edit the languages .html, .css and .js to develop this website. and used google chrome inspect element to check how the website looks.

it links google fonts for the custom fonts.


## Testing

There were many bugs with the alignment of the submission buttons, text and images. with some of ai's help, I managed to fix them. (trial and error with ai's help)

submission buttons sent me to a non existant website, i had to link them back to the page they are in instead. (linked them to their own page so it refereshes instead)

The search button didnt work because i didnt link my .js properly at the bottom of the html code. (moved the script to the bottom of every html page.)

the search couldnt find the games when there were spaces. (fixed after changing js code to lowercase and delete spaces in user input)
